# Graphs JS
A simple web-based graph visualization tool using p5.js library. Allows user to create nodes and edges, and visualize the graph. Also allows user to set fixed weights for nodes and edges, and toggle tree mode.

## Demo
[Check out the demo](https://danny-wits.github.io/graphs_Js/)

## Features

* Create nodes and edges
* Visualize the graph
* Set fixed weights for nodes and edges
* Toggle tree mode

## How to use

1. Open the demo in your browser
2. Right Click on the canvas to create a node
3. Click on a node and drag to create an edge
4. Use the checkboxes to set fixed weights for nodes and edges, and toggle tree mode
5. Use the sidebox to view the selected node, start node, and target node

## Technologies used

* p5.js library for graph visualization
* HTML and CSS for layout and styling
* JavaScript for logic and event handling

## Algorithms

The project uses the following algorithms:

* Breadth First Search (BFS): used to traverse the graph level by level
* Depth First Search (DFS): used to traverse the graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
* Dijkstra's Algorithm: used to find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph
